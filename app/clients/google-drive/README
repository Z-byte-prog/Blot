Todo:
- [X] Get authentication working
- [X] Get dis-authentication working
- [ ] Get sync working (i.e. self-initiated)
- [ ] Get .write and .remove working 
- [ ] Get webhooks working (will require tunnelling)

Questions
- is there an overhead to creating the oauth2 client each time? can we safely reuse it?
- is it possible to restrict Blot's access to a single folder in the google drive?
  - it doesn't seem like it is

I believe we will need this API for drive changes:

Since the changes.list api doesn't return rename events, it seems.
